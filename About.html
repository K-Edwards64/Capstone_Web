      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>      Home security features locally have mostly been confined to home security cameras and motion activated lighting systems or are completely absent as is the case in most homes. This creates prime opportunities for nefarious activities, putting many home owners at risk of robberies and homicides in homes equipped with these primitive methods of security. In contrast, most high end security systems implement artificial intelligence and deep neural networks to enhance home security.
        <br> 

        This project aims to enhance home security by integrating deep neural networks with home security systems, specifically targeting the lighting system for a driveway authenticated through license plate number recognition and an audio passcode from the driver.
        <br>
  The bigger picture? Developing an enhanced home security system that can recognize home owners and other permitted individuals and perform security measures that improve protection and quality of life, I.E garage door control, smart home monitoring and integration with smart homes.
